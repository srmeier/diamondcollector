level (database)
/*
- to read in data for a particular level the program runs SELECT * FROM tiles;,
	then a 2D array is created using the tile_id as the linear index and
	sprite_id as an index into the sprites array (which will be created after),
	then another array is created using tile_id as the linear index and
	action_id as an index into the array of function pointers which the game
	has compiled already. Finally, the game looks through the array of
	sprite_id-s and runs SELECT * FROM sprites WHERE sprite_id = %d; then from
	each entry a SDL_Surface* is created and the sprite is built
